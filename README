# JAM

[Documentation](http://the-42viral-project.readthedocs.org)


## Usage
Usage is pretty straight forward, simply create a config file under jam/config. Name the file whatever you want and add a $FILES array. This array will contanin the path to all of the CSS and JavaScript files you wat to include on a page. The demo config looks like the following:

~/jam/config/demo

	#!/bin/bash

	FILES="
		demo/source/css/a.css 
		demo/source/css/b.css
		demo/source/css/c.css
		demo/source/js/1.js
		demo/source/js/2.js
		demo/source/js/3.js
	"

To combine and minify the assets, first make sure the build script is executable.

	chmod +x build

Then call the build script and pass the name of the desired config file as a parameter.

	./build demo 

Now if you look in ~/jam/css and ~/jam/js you will see both combined and minifiy files of the respective type.
